# Governance

_Last updated: 2026-01-09_

## Purpose

This section documents the operating rules for building ChronoLedger, including how responsibilities are split across human contributors and AI agents.

## What lives here

- **Contributor rules:** project contribution standards and non-negotiables (strict TDD, readability, SOLID/DRY)
- **Git workflow:** branching, PR expectations, and promotion model alignment
- **Role charters:** responsibilities and deliverables for each project role (human and AI agent use)
- **Backlog workflow:** how requirements become user stories and vertical slices
- **Templates:** canonical human-facing templates (ADRs, decision logs, retrospectives, stories, slices)
