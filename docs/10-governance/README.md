# Governance

_Last updated: 2026-01-04_

## Purpose

This section documents the operating rules for building ChronoLedger: how we collaborate, how changes flow through review, and how responsibilities are split across human contributors and AI agents.

## What lives here

- **Contributor rules:** project contribution standards and non-negotiables (strict TDD, readability, SOLID/DRY)
- **Git workflow:** branching, PR expectations, and promotion model alignment
- **Role charters:** responsibilities and deliverables for each project role (human and AI agent use)

## Documents

- [Contributor standards](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Git workflow](git-workflow.md)
- [Role charters index](roles/README.md)
