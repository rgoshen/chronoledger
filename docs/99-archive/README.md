# Archive

Historical or superseded documents kept for traceability.

## Contents

- TimeKeeper-era initial requirements (moved here intentionally)

## Conventions

- Keep archived docs stable (avoid changing filenames once referenced).
- Add a short note at the top of an archived doc pointing to the current replacement.
