# Reports and Exports

Defines “official” report/export outputs (PDF-first) and reporting rules.

## Contents

(TBD — add links as files land.)

## Recommended additions (pre-coding blockers)

- `reports-catalog.md` (export list + field specs + grouping/sorting + template versions)
- `pdf-testing.md` (deterministic rendering strategy + golden fixtures)
