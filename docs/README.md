## Reading order (recommended)

1. Roadmap → 2. Requirements → 3. ADRs → 4. API + Data → 5. Reports → 6. Infra → 7. Testing → 8. UX → 9. Reference

## ADRs vs supporting docs

- **ADRs** capture decisions (what we decided and why) and should change rarely once accepted.
- **Supporting docs** are deeper, evolving notes that back the ADRs and implementation plans. Those live in `09-reference/`.
